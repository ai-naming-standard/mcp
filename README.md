## 💡 Who is this for?

✅ Anyone using AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor  
✅ People struggling with too many files  
✅ Teams wanting consistent file naming rules  
✅ Anyone wanting AI to understand their project better

---

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

### ❌ Before: Confusing File Names

```
login.js
user_page_final_v2.jsx
payment_fixed.py
test123.sql
```

**Result:** AI gets confused and makes mistakes 😵

### ✅ After: Clear File Names

```
001_FE_User-Login_C_Page_PROD.jsx
002_BE_Payment-Process_X_API_PROD.py
003_DB_User-Schema_C_Migration_PROD.sql
004_TEST_Login_Unit_DEV.test.js
```

**Result:** AI understands perfectly and helps better! ✨

## 🎁 What You Get

### 1. 🤖 AI Understands Your Intent

**Just say in plain language:**
- "Create a login page" → AI makes: `001_FE_User-Login_C_Page_PROD.jsx`
- "Add payment refund API" → AI makes: `021_BE_Payment-Refund_C_API_PROD.py`
- "Create product table" → AI makes: `005_DB_Product-Schema_C_Migration_PROD.sql`

### 2. 📁 8 Simple Folders

Your project stays organized automatically:

```
my-project/
├── 00_DOCS/      📚 Documentation
├── 01_CONFIG/    ⚙️ Settings
├── 02_STATIC/    📦 Images, fonts
├── 03_ACTIVE/    🔥 Your main code
├── 04_TEST/      🧪 Tests
├── 05_BUILD/     🏗️ Build files
├── 06_LOGS/      📊 Logs
└── 07_META/      🎯 AI collaboration files
```

### 3. 🤝 Multiple AIs Work Together

- **Claude** writes code
- **Cursor** reviews it
- **ChatGPT** designs structure
- **All understand the same rules!**

### 4. 📝 Automatic Record Keeping

Everything is tracked automatically:
- Who did what
- When it was done
- Which files depend on each other

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install

```bash
npm install -g ai-naming-standard-mcp
```

### Step 2: Tell Your AI

Just copy this into your Claude or Cursor settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-naming-standard": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/ai-naming-standard-mcp/src/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Start Using!

Tell your AI in plain language:
- "Create a user dashboard page"
- "Add email verification API"
- "Make a product database table"

**That's it!** 🎉

## 📖 Real Examples

### Example 1: Building a Shopping Site

**You say:** "I need a shopping cart page"

**AI creates:**
```
015_FE_Cart-Shopping_R_Page_PROD.jsx
```

**You can tell it means:**
- `015` - File number (easy to find)
- `FE` - Frontend (it's a webpage)
- `Cart-Shopping` - Shopping cart feature
- `R` - Read/Display (shows information)
- `Page` - It's a page
- `PROD` - For production (real site)

### Example 2: Team Collaboration

**Before:**
- John makes: `login_page.jsx`
- Sarah makes: `LoginPage.jsx`
- Mike makes: `user-login-component.jsx`
- 😵 Everyone confused!

**After:**
- Everyone makes: `001_FE_User-Login_C_Page_PROD.jsx`
- ✨ Perfect consistency!

## 🎓 How File Names Work

Don't worry - you don't need to memorize this!  
**Just tell AI what you want, and it creates the correct name.**

But if you're curious, here's how it works:

```
[Number]_[Where]_[What]-[Detail]_[Action]_[Type]_[Environment]
```

**Examples:**

| File Name | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `001_FE_User-Login_C_Page_PROD.jsx` | Frontend login page (creating) |
| `002_BE_Payment-Process_X_Service_PROD.py` | Backend payment service (executing) |
| `003_DB_Order-Schema_C_Migration_PROD.sql` | Database order table (creating) |

**Where (Layer):**
- `FE` = Frontend (what users see)
- `BE` = Backend (server logic)
- `DB` = Database (data storage)
- `API` = API (connects things)

**Action:**
- `C` = Create (making new)
- `R` = Read (showing)
- `U` = Update (changing)
- `D` = Delete (removing)
- `X` = Execute (processing)
