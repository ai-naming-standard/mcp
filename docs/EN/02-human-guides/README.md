## 💬 What You'll Learn

### 1. Proper Request Methods
```
❌ Bad: "Create a file"
✅ Good: "Create a user login page in 03_ACTIVE folder"
```

### 2. Using Natural Language
```
"Add payment feature. Backend in Python, frontend in React"
→ AI automatically generates filename + writes code
```

### 3. Effective Feedback
```
❌ "It's weird"
✅ "The login button should be centered, not on the right"
```
